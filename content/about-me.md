**Who am I?** My work and hobby for over 20 years has been programming. I'm most proficient in web application development, but I also have a guilty pleasure of tinkering with code close to the hardware, so I really enjoy Arduino, ESP, and similar platforms. On the other hand, I love having everything virtual and containerized, so today I can't imagine life without Docker!

I guess I could say I'm a full-stack developer. I've even built my own hardware for one project, but I'm more inclined to focus purely on the backend.
Specifically, in recent years I've been using Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. But don't worry, I'm not just a dry coder; I enjoy playing with the frontend, like Vue.js, although it doesn't excite me as much anymore.

Historically, I've been working with PHP and everything related to it for over 15 years.
My idealistic self would like to do only open-source work and help others. This is why I'm a sworn Linux user and Windows is not allowed in my house... unless I want to play a computer game.

My big hobby in recent years has been working with leather. Because everything work-related is intangible and I don't see the results of my work, I like to make something with my own hands. And leather is the perfect material for that. So when I'm not at the keyboard, I'm at the sewing machine or workbench.
